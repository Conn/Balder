RawPngBufferStream:
	Switch from BitConverter to something else to avoid it from using new() - GC predictability
	Prearrange the main buffer and how it is copied, including block info and lengths for all blocks
	
Structs:
	Use ref for method arguments instead - a lot faster - by value invokes a construction of a new version and copies it all into the new one
	
Drawing primitives:
	Use span rendering - sorted front to back, automatically clip with already drawn spans and skip any pixels
	that is not needed to draw
	
Framebuffer:
	If possible - use uint framebuffer instead of byte[] - a lot faster having one memory access instead of 4 (RGBA)
